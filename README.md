# Arduino-RTOS
Real time operating system makes easier to perform multitasking.

## Introduction
In this project i will demonstrate how an rtos can perform better in multitasking in comparision with traditional programming approach for 
arduino uno. In this project we are going to combine the two task and doing both with the RTOS and without RTOS.

## Prerequisite
  - Arduino UNO x 1
  - LED x 1 (I'm using on board led on pin 13)
  - Connecting wires x 6
  - Variable resistor/ pot(I'm using here bunch of resistor as a pot)
 
## Libraries
  - Arduino_FreeRTOS.h(You can download it from the Arduino IDE from manage library section in tools or Ctrl+Shift+I)

## Task
In this project i'm going to combine the blinking of led and the analog read task. We can combine more task as we want
